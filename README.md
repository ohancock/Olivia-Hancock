## About Me 

I am an information specialist. I have a Master of Library and Information Studies from the University of Alabama and a Bachelor of Journalism from the University of Missouri. My passion is empowering people by connecting them with the information they need. 

I have interned at Oregon Health and Science University, St. Louis University Law Library and the Law Library Association of St. Louis. I also worked as a library assistant and page at St. Charles City-County Library District. My career goal is to apply my research and communication skills to making information open and accessible. 

I am an independent worker who is able to locate, assimilate and convey complex information. I enjoy collaborative problem solving, meticulous editing and, in true librarian form, afternoons lost to a good book.
