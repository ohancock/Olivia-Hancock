## About Me 

I am a scholarly communication intern at Oregon Health and Science University Library. I have a Master of Library and Information Studies from the University of Alabama and a Bachelor of Journalism from the University of Missouri. Libraries are my passion, and communication is my expertise. 

In addition to my work at OHSU, I have completed internships at St. Louis University Law Library and the Law Library Association of St. Louis. I also worked as a library assistant and page at St. Charles City-County Library District. My career goal is to connect people with information in the most efficient way possible. I want to use my research and communication skills to make libraries accessible and their patrons empowered. 

I am an independent worker who is able to locate, assimilate and convey complex information. I enjoy collaborative problem solving, meticulous editing and, in true librarian form, afternoons lost to a good book.
